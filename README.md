# Resilience-Oriented Planning Map

Created in ArcGIS Pro, the Resilience-Oriented Planning Map shows an overlay of all thirty-five HALCs with additional layers that show the environmental hazards in and around the vicinity of each HALC (Fig. 1). Some of the hazards that the map takes into account are landslide events and flood zone areas. The map allows the user to assess the risk exposure of each HALC to these potential hazards and identify the highest value retrofit projects for each one.

The Resilience-Oriented Planning Map is a geodatabase file created in ArcGIS Pro (v. 2.5.0) in order to provide quick reference of the 35 Healthy Active Living Centers in relation to the various hazards and other feature layers of interests. The user can easily turn on and off feature layers to answer specific queries, or add additional layers to open up entirely new fields of inquiry. Complete documentation of the data layers included in this map can be found in the accompanying Data Documentation file.

The map includes a number of hazard feature layers, which enable the user to assess the risk posed to specific Healthy Active Living Centers by proximity to established flood zones and landslide prone areas as well as a wide variety of discrete hazards, including storm damage, stormwater runoff, and sewage overflows. Within the map, these features are overlaid with tenth-mile and quarter-mile buffers around the Healthy Active Living Center to more accurately assess the risk exposure of each center (Fig. 3).

Likewise, S&R staff can use the trees and air quality layers to identify centers where black carbon (shown) or other pollutants may pose a threat to patrons for prioritizing the installation of air purifiers, filters, or planting trees (Figure 4).

Also included in the map are feature layers useful for scoping suitable sites for the development of green infrastructure, including green roofs, permeable pavement, and rain gardens (Fig. 5). These layers were imported from a more comprehensive study into the siting and cost effectiveness of such green infrastructure projects for the city of Pittsburgh.
